We will be making a career matchmaking system where we will create a menu that will have a questionnaire, allowing the users to give us their gender, age, and level of education up until Masters. 
Once they do so, they can go through picking out their traits that will be used to coincide with their new jobs
from their jobs will pop up, showing a title and description before they ultimately pick out their new job and continue with it, happily ever after.
